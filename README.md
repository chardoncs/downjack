It can set up `.gitignore` and licenses in your projects with damn-fast speed.

## Usage

For example, if you want to set up `.gitignore` for a Go project:

```bash
downjack gitignore go
# OR simply
downjack g go
# OR fuzzy find
downjack g
```

then create a license file with `MIT` license:

```bash
downjack license mit
# OR simply
downjack l mit
# OR again fuzzy find
downjack l
```

and that's it, your project is now ready to work with!

```
